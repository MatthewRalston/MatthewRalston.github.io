## Life science experience
 
If you are looking for a experienced molecular biologist, analytical chemist, and scientist with a balance of laboratory skills and statistics/analytical experience, look no further.
  
My experience with laboratory techniques begins with my Bachelor of Science (BSc Biochemistry, 2012) at the University of Delaware and the Delaware Biotechnology Institute where I performed Northern/Western blots, RT-PCR, Illumina RNA-seq, ELISA, cell culture, IHC, microscopy and many other techniques in GLP/aseptic environments.
 
My research included the prediction and validation of functional RNAs and elucidating their roles in both human/mammalian cells and in bacteria. I worked in areas as a generalist in 2 labs: the Helen Graham Cancer Center's Center for Translational Cancer Research (CTCR, 2009-2012) and the Delaware Biotechnology Institutes laboratory for biofuels research under renowned chemical engineer, genetic engineer, and metabolic engineer Terry Papoutsakis. 
 
 > While there, I performed the first strand-specific RNA-seq experiment in the *Clostridia* genus.
 
 I used the Ribo-Zero kit and Epicenter's ScriptSeq Illumina RNA-seq preparation kit to prepare RNA samples from aliquots sampled from my bioreactors to cross-validate novel RNA species, riboswitches, cis-antisense RNAs, lncRNAs, mRNAs, and other molecular species of the transcriptome, to then additionally validate by Northern blot.
