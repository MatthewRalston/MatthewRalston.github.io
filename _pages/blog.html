<h1>Bridging Software and Biology: Technology and Genomics in the age of AI</h1>

<p>The focus of this blog is topics on machine-learning, AI, Genomics, Phylogenomics, Bioinformatic methods, data analysis and statistical methods for interpreting molecular and/or genomic assays.  I review topics on AI, statistics, probability, linear algebra, multiplexed expression profiling methods, regression, 'meta-programming' and old-school principles first coding, TDD, DSA, applications programming and new-school AI-assisted software engineering. You may find poetry, prose, and other tech news related discussions. I work on a project related to minimizers, k-mers, alignment and quasi-mapping and that is often visited in this blog as well. </p>

This blog Explores the intersection of biology, chemistry, and technology, delving into topics such as bioinformatics, algorithms, software development, and biotechnology. From decoding genomic data, writing reproducible and professional reports, analyzing data, to building command-line data analysis software, this blog covers it all. I discuss challenges and innovatios shapping the future of life sciences and ML/AI-driven research.
