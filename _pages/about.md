# Industry experience


### Wet-bench Molecular Biology and Biochemistry

> 5+ years of published laboratory biochemistry and molecular biology expertise

I have worked in a variety of laboratory settings including analytical chemistry, organic synthesis, molecular biology and disease physiology research, translational oncology labs with patient tissue samples, extreme anaerobic and BSL-2 microbiolgy aseptic culture, and much more. In addition to laminar-flow hoods and GLP environments, I am familiar with a wide range of instrumentation and bioassay designs. I have worked with qRT-PCR, immunological assays, immunofluorescence, Northern/Western blots, HPLC, GC/LC-MS, UV-VIS and more. Please see the [skills](#skills) section for specific details and a list of known lab protocols.

I keep a meticulous laboratory notebook. I can re-run samples if quality is off (e.g. RIN score). Also, I deeply enjoy performing molecular assays at the bench, whether its genomics, microbiology, human or mammalian disease pathology, genetics, and physiology. I am detail oriented and very organized and I focus on replicate quality in-between samples and I understand instrument limitations, positive controls, and core goals of hypothesis testing and data modeling.

If you're looking for a hybrid wet-bench and data scientist who can aliquot 1uL reagents to pipette instrument tolerance, or who can run a multi-factor experiment or bioassay from innoculation through sample preparation and instrumental analysis, I'm your guy.


### Agile scientific and cloud computing meets software development expertise

> 10+ years of software development experience

I primarily work in GNU/Linux and MacOS/OSX environments  on biological sequence analysis, data science, and **Illumina short-read WGS/WES/RNAseq** problems. I have 5 years of industry experience writing **Python, Perl, R, Javascript, HTML/CSS, SQL,** bash and recently, web applications (React.js, Leptos, WASM) and safe-memory GUIs/TUIs with **Rust**. 

My projects have included technologies such as kubernetes code, Dockerized workflows, shell scripts for HPC environments and grid engines like UGE/SGE and SLURM. I can build MVC/MVVC web applications and I studied database systems (SQL) at the graduate level.

I specialize in writing command-line interface (CLI) tools including languages like Python, Perl, R, NodeJS, and Rust. Nvidia CUDA GPU programming and distributed environments are an additional strength for applications requiring excessive parallelism. 

Also, my experience with web application development, relational databases (Microsoft SQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite3 and libSQL, Oracle SQL, Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) and equivalent on commodity cloud vendors), Javascript/HTML/CSS, front-end frameworks (mostly Alpine.js, React, Jquery, Jquery-UI, D3.js, and SVG), REST-API design, and database normalizations and architecture lets me create strong tools for developers and scientists alike.


Specific stories and industry experiences are given below.

- Developed robust backend systems using Python, NodeJS, and R to streamline data processing workflows.
- Demonstrated excellence in laboratory skillsets with replicate correlation coefficients > 95% on Illumina HiSeq 2500 RNA-Seq libraries.
- Implemented cloud infrastructure on AWS, leveraging services such as EC2, S3, and Lambda for scalable and cost-effective solutions.
- Containerized applications and workflows using Docker and Kubernetes (k8s), ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
- Utilized Linux command line tools, including bash, grep, and sed, for data manipulation and system administration tasks.
- Designed and implemented interactive data visualizations using D3.js, enhancing data-driven decision-making processes.
- Scripted automation tasks in Perl and Python to optimize repetitive processes, reducing manual effort by 40%.
- Managed document preparation and typesetting using LaTeX for high-quality technical documentation.

## Team skills

* Culture:
  
With excellent recommendations from industry managers on the topics of productivity, code maintainance, and team behaviors, I've delivered value on projects within integrated teams of laboratory scientists, programmers, engineers, and managers on projects in wet-bench biology, bioinformatic and cheminformatic research areas. I take statistics, data, and modeling efforts seriously and I encourage you to check out the my [/software](/software) page, the [/research](/research) page, my life sciences message at [/biosciences](/biosciences), my profile on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/matthewralston), and my manager [testimonials](#testimonials) section and perhaps my publicly facing [GitHub](https://github.com/MatthewRalston) and [/portfolio](/portfolio) pages. You'll also see I have expert familiarity with publishing first-author and collaborating author articles. I write usable and effective documentation, I am a guru with literate programming topics such as Rmarkdown, markdown, Pandoc, Infrastructure-as-code (IAC), and reproducibilty reports and analyses. I boast 3-5 modest open source genomics projects concerning sequence alignment conceptural understanding, molecular species and diversity, correlation analyses, k-mer and minimizer expertise, and Illumina sequence data profiling. I am enthusiastic about my software engineering, my scientific and code development, and my Discovery and R&D processes.

  
* Communication:

With proficiencies in technical writing, science, engineering, and stats/probability/mathematics, I've delivered value and knowledge to others without losing touch. Your high-value team demands written style and know-how in publications, meetings, and documentation. Clear and compelling written style is essential to today's business successes, tomorrow's publications, and your quarterly progress. Check out the [publications](/publications) or [testimonials](#testimonials) sections for more reasons why I'm a **above ordinary and spectacular fit** for your business needs.
