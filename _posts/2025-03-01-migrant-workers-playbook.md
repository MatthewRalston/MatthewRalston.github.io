Remember to document unsafe labor practices. The only way to properly report incidents including lost wages is to include:

- Dates worked
- A description of the unsafe, hazardous, or unnecessarily difficult standard for the days work.
- Names of witnesses to the unsafe labor conditions
- Name, phone number, and address of the employer
- Photographs, screenshots, video, or audio recordings of exchanges between a stubborn employer and reasonable requests for accomodation
- Steps taken already to negotiate or solve problems
- The name and contact information of a Spanish language Civil Rights lawyer in your area
- Any relevant OSHA report numbers concerning the incident(s)
- Any history of unsafe labor practices, lawsuits, or other concerns regarding the employer.

>Remember! You are working hard, do not be cheated, poisoned, or mismanaged. Don't compromise your health and safety repeatedly for a bad employer.


## Protecting Farmworkers: 

- How to Report Unsafe Labor Conditions and Demand Justice


### The Reality of Unsafe Labor Conditions in Agriculture

Migrant and seasonal agricultural workers form the backbone of America’s food production. Yet, many farmers and workers labor under **dangerous and unlawful conditions**, facing exposure to toxic pesticides, lack of access to clean drinking water, unpaid hours, and substandard housing. **These conditions** not only threaten workers’ health and well-being but also **violate federal and state labor laws**.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) enforce laws meant to protect agricultural workers. However, **many farmworkers are unaware of their rights** or fear retaliation from employers. If you or someone you know is experiencing unsafe working conditions, it is essential to take action.


- How to Report Unsafe Working Conditions

Workers have the legal right to report hazardous conditions without fear of retaliation. If you are exposed to pesticides without proper protective gear, denied water or restroom access, or forced to work without pay, follow these steps:

### Report workplace hazards or unfair treatment:

Report to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)

Online: Submit a complaint through the [OSHA Complaint Form](https://www.osha.gov/workers/file-complaint)

By Phone: Call OSHA at 1-800-321-6742 (OSHA) to report safety violations.

By Mail/Fax: Download and complete the OSHA complaint form and send it to your nearest OSHA regional office.

### File a Wage Complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor

If you have worked unpaid hours or received less than minimum wage, file a complaint with the DOL’s Wage and Hour Division.

Employers violating wage laws can face serious penalties, including back pay for workers.

### Seek Legal Assistance

Many civil rights attorneys and nonprofit organizations provide free legal representation for farmworkers. They can file lawsuits on behalf of workers to demand compensation for lost wages, unsafe conditions, and labor violations.

Groups like [Farmworker Justice](https://www.farmworkerjustice.org/) and [Legal Aid at Work](https://legalaidatwork.org/) help workers navigate their legal rights.

### The Role of Civil Rights Attorneys in Holding Employers Accountable

Civil rights and labor attorneys play a crucial role in advocating for farmworkers’ rights. They take legal action against employers who:

- **Expose workers to toxic pesticides** without safety training or protective equipment.

- **Deny access to clean drinking water and sanitary restrooms** during work shifts.

- **Fail to pay wages on time** or manipulate hours to avoid overtime pay.

-  **Retaliate against workers** who report safety violations or attempt to unionize.

Legal professionals not only fight for individual workers but also push for systemic changes, ensuring employers comply with labor protections under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA) and the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).
Take Action: Demand Safe and Fair Working Conditions

## Unsafe work environments **are illegal**!!

Unsafe labor conditions should never be tolerated. If you or a coworker are experiencing workplace violations:

- 1. **Document Everything**: Take notes, photos, and videos of unsafe conditions.

Talk to Advocacy Groups: Contact local farmworker advocacy organizations for support.

- 2. **Report Violations**: Use OSHA and DOL complaint forms to file official reports.

- 3. **Seek Legal Help**: Reach out to labor attorneys who specialize in farmworker rights.


By standing together, farmworkers can demand safe, fair, and dignified working conditions. The law is on your side—use it to protect yourself and your fellow workers.
