Customization is essential for maximizing visual appeal and ease of use of the computer system.

'Ricing' or system customization may be adding a new editor, or connecting an outside resource via an API token. It might be just configuring the environment and software to properly support each other, in an ideal DevOps situation. Adding software, hotkeys, or other system layers allows the user to combine functionality, when performing their tasks. 



My customization goals:


I would like to produce lower quality terminal experiences, richer than average for web application servers, using a web service framework and ORM, and load balancing.


I'd like to familiarize myself with org templating to provide richer menu driven development and generative functions when working on workflow.

I'd like to eventually totally drive specific rich workflows with TUI and CLI experiences, monitoring, and then eventually dashboard around specific experiences I'd like to insource into a company.
