## Preface

>This country is under attack. Here's why it's not from the ivory tower. I'll give you X pieces of evidence with why it's not from the press or from the schools, teachers, or liberals who promote education. Feel free to interpret the bias however you want. That said, I'd urge the reader to ask themselves why the economy has been in a stand-still for years, why rents are up, buying a house is impossible for most millenials, and why the government would have cause to lie about job statistics to keep the S&P500 and other wall st institutions from addressing true concerns for the future of America.


We take it for granted that because America has been around for centuries, it will continue to be the best country in the world. This may not be the case. I'm not saying this to give you more anxieties than you already have. I'm saying this because there are several reasons that seem obvious to me, and I'm going to tell you why attacking and scapegoating education and free press is not the solution.

First, the Declaration of Independence is not a legal document. It is a description of the reason why we seceeded from the colonial system of oppressive taxation and serfdom of the kingdom of England. The Constitution was signed on September 17th, 1787. This document, and later the Bill of Rights, enshrines some fundamental rights for U.S. citizens that would later be extended to members of all races and of both sexes. 

## Freedom of speech and freedom of the press

The constitution offers us rights to say "anything" we want (there are some situations for benefit of public safety where certain rights do not permit us to interfere with the rights of others, such as shouting "fire" in a movie theater). This is part of the First Amendment rights rights that are extended to both U.S. Citizens and resident and non-resident aliens. Most of us agree that the "Freedom of Speech" is a modern and important right for the proper functioning of society, as well as democracy. Consider the opposite: if you or I can be coerced into saying things (or not saying things) against our will, or because of expressing viewpoints that run contrary to other U.S. citizens or even politicians, then something may be dreadfully wrong. 

How would you like it if I told you I was being censored from saying "Biden is old, had memory problems, and is overly concerned with popular opinion and the politics of the suppression of conservative viewpoints?" If I'm not allowed to say that another citizen, or even a person in position of power is acting bad, then how will anyone be able to report a crime and have the police investigate it? I'm not accusing the government under one political party of illegal behavior (though they do, both parties) or being better than another administration. I'm not picking a side in this argument. Even though I am trying to make a point about "modern" 2020s conservatism, you have thick skin so you can take it, right?

<summary><strong>Does the First Amendment apply to citizens and non-citizens alike in the U.S.A.?</strong></summary>
<p>A resident alien is someone with a Green Card. They have similar rights to U.S. Citizens such as the freedom from improper search and seizure by the police. As many believe, this doesn't 'detract' from the rights of U.S. Citizens to afford this benefit to resident and non-resident aliens, temporary workers, and even illegal immigrants. What this does is force the police to have better practices and standards for proving individual guilt, rather than circumstantially compromising 'evidence' that such as planting drugs, improper detention and coerced confessions, and more.</p>

That said, the "memory problems" weren't the biggest issue with the Biden administration. It wasn't CHIPS or clean energy, or other policy boondoggles. The problem with Trump *isn't* that he is popular or unpopular. It isn't even the allegations of womanizing and supporting/defending racist or <span class="hover-image-container"><a href="#">ableist</a><span class="hover-image-wrapper"><img class="hover-image" src="/assets/img/adam_schiff_elon_musk_brain_comment.jpg" alt="Hover image"/><span class="image-caption">Elon insulting a congressman about his brain size, in reference to selective censorship on Twitter</span></span></span> slogans and tweets on those subjects by Elon Musk.


### The Trump administration's thoughts on ableism

, racism, and selective Freedom of Speech

[The Hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3780280-musk-lashes-out-at-schiff-in-now-deleted-tweet-your-brain-is-too-small/) wrote an <span class="hover-image-container"><a href="#">article describing a "deleted tweet"</a><span class="hover-image-wrapper"><img class="hover-image" src="/assets/img/TheHill_AdamSchiff_ElonMusck_brain_size_comment.png" alt="Hover image"/><span class="image-caption">The Hill's account of Elon deleting this tweet is corroborated by Yahoo, Fox, others. There is no single source information that "must be trusted", making fact checking more difficult.</span></span></span> where Elon accussed a sitting congressman of having a 'small brain', which is an allusion to an old <span class="hover-image-container"><a href="#">eugenics euphemism</a><span class="hover-image-wrapper"><img class="hover-image" src="/assets/img/elonmusk_news_accuracy.webp" alt="Hover image"/><span class="image-caption">Here is Elon being defensive about being labeled a Nazi sympathizer</span></span></span> and belief that persons of color, or women, other minority groups have smaller brains and are thus less able to think than 'big brain' males. (If you're a male, you're valid, unique and have dignity even when the world doesn't make you feel that way. That said, your value and uniqueness *doesn't* come from being a male.)

	<summary><strong>Why does "deleting" tweets matter?</strong></summary>
	<p>Deleting a tweet suggests guilt or shame. Deleting a tweet where you insult someone not by the caliber of their thoughts or the merits of their actions, but by something like the color of their skin, their biological sex or gender, their appearance, their 'brain size' is not just bigoted, it's a form of hate-speech. Deleting information from the internet suggests manipulation and guilt associated with something said. It could also be used to reference something that was never said, such as in a photoshopped image. In this example, <span class="hover-image-container"><a href="#">Googling for "Elon Musk Adam Schiff brain comment"</a><span class="hover-image-wrapper"><img class="hover-image" src="/assets/img/Google_search_adamschiff_elonmusk_brain_comment.png" alt="Hover image"/><span class="image-caption">Fox News, The Hill, the Washington Examiner, and Yahoo News, also claim the tweet was deleted.</span></span></span> reveals a number of new outlets where reporters reference the same deleted Tweet, the same text of the tweet, and the same deletion event. It's likely that because Fox News said it's deleted and the Hill, the Washington Examiner, and Yahoo news (lol) report the same event, that there is some basis that the tweet existed and was live and was then deleted for containing offesnive or legally dubious content.</p>

More recently in the news, Trump has been attacking minorities and civil rights of minorities by describing several recent (Feb 25) plane crashes as the result of DEI. [Mother Jones summarized]( https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/01/trump-dc-plane-crash-dei-conspiracy/) sentiment from recent press conferences and ableist and racist statements about the FAA air traffic controllers. Civil rights groups "[Center for Disability Rights](https://cdrnys.org/blog/uncategorized/the-center-for-disability-rights-condemns-statements-by-president-trump-blaming-people-with-disabilities-for-the-crash-of-american-eagle-flight-5342/)", "[American Association of People with Disabilities](https://www.aapd.com/ableist-trump-comments-september-24/)" and "[National Disability Rights Network](https://www.ndrn.org/resource/dca-crash/)" all released blog articles concerning the recent ableist remarks and associated violence-enabling rhetoric issues by the President.
