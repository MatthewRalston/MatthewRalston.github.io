I came to life from two unknown trees,
Roots tangled deep in mystery's seas.
Yet arms reached out, so strong, so kind,
To plant me anew, a love redesigned.

A patchwork quilt, a story untold,
Warmed by hands both gentle and bold.
Not born of blood, but of choice divine,
This woven bond became my lifeline.

Through skies I soar, with wings to mend,
Guided by love that will not bend.
Adopted not just into a name,
But into a family where hearts inflame.
