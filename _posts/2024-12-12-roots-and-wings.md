<!-- Every day is sacred, bad attitudes may gain you something.. usually nothing at all. Even though they're big and scary, please oh please oh please you won't listen to nice words at all. We all take them for granted...and that only grows more horrifying with time. One day... there won't be any more. You'll be alone. I'll be gone. The past will seem a long ways away and you'll crave and cry and you'll never believe me if I could explain the pain you will feel. So bad it'll probably kill something inside of you. It's better to be a good person and always always ask for what you need, not for what you want, and don't take, bitch, complain, moan, or drag your feet about ANYTHING. Honestly... not gonna sugar coat it. Take a female out to the movies, don't neck, hold her hand. That's the most intimate thing in the world honestly... and bad boys forget how close that really is. DOn't be like me. THere's a time for bad attitude, but it's not a good time. The smiles around someone doing stuff like I did usually are insincere and from enemies, even the ones that are physically there... the ones your grateful for, and the ones that you're not. Either way, fate and Christ the King control your destiny, but you're there to make sure people got it right about you, seeing you at your worst.... and at your _best_!! glhf. ggwp. sr m. sr a. sr n. coffee? bitch about the weather? go for a walk? -->

I came to life from two unknown trees,
Roots tangled deep in mystery's seas.
Yet arms reached out, so strong, so kind,
To plant me anew, a love redesigned.

A patchwork quilt, a story untold,
Warmed by hands both gentle and bold.
Not born of blood, but of choice divine,
This woven bond became my lifeline.

Through skies I soar, with wings to mend,
Guided by love that will not bend.
Adopted not just into a name,
But into a family where hearts inflame.
