## Engineering skills


* Computer Science MSc. (**MSc. in Comptuer Science**, concentration in bioinformatics, **3.96 GPA,** UD 2015)

In addition to my considerable training in analytical/physical/organic chemistries and molecular biology and genomics, I possess very strong skills in programming and data science. With a bioinformatics major in graduate school at Univ. of Delaware, I have formal training in advanced calculus, machine learning and statistics,  and software engineering. 

Additionally, I have practiced many skills in industry, leading efforts in Bristol-Myers Squibb company initiatives such as legacy software development and maintainance, reproducible research, dashboard development, software application development, database management and data version control, and programming language adoption.
