### Undergraduate program

I developed laboratory fundamentals as a wet-bench laboratory biochemist and molecular biologist. I learned aseptic culture, some immunological, and fluorescent assay techniques, and RT-PCR in a translational cancer laboratory. The UD chemistry department emphasized other laboratory fundamentals such as HPLC, GC-MS, spectrometry, and organic synthesis.

Subects studied include organic chemistry, physical chemistry and thermodynamics, and biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, physiology, microbiology, virology, physics, linear algebra, probability, calc I/II/III and others.

### Graduate program

My thesis was hybrid wet-lab and dry-lab 2-year project developing the first strand-specific Illumina NGS map of the *C. acetobutylicum* transcriptome during solventogensis and sporulation stresses. Owing of course to the help of Drs. Papoutsakis and Venkataramanan, I investigated the whole-transcriptome response of a biofuel-producing bacterium to the biophysical stresses of solvent/biofuel accumulation and associated stress-response adaptations in anaerobic fermentation conditions. I formulated a fixed media, prepared the bioreactors and innocula, sampled across time points for small molecule characterization by HPLC, RNA-quality investigation, subsequent PCR-mediated Illumina HiSeq 2500 library prepration, and delivered my samples to the Delaware Biotech. Institute core for sequencing. 

Afterwards, I developed both genome browser and interactive volcano-plot visualization web-applications for assessing differential expression of transcripts across the time-stress design.

Subjects included in my graduate program include metabolic engineering, bioinformatics, biostatistics, computational biology, database systems, algorithm topics, sequence alignment, Illumina NGS, biostatistics, Linux HPC training, web application development, Perl, Python and bourne shell (bash) programming.
