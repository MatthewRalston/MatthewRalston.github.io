kmer.js is a NodeJS package designed for data/science applications. It addresses the 'k-mer' problem(substrings of length from a string) in a simple and performant manner. This library produces all of the n - k + 1 substrings of length k from a string of length n.

It can read `.fasta` or `.fastq` input by using `bionode-fasta` (for fastq, use my `fastqparser.js` library).
